This GUI Application's function is to retrieve the weather from any city in the world user submits in the text box. I had to use a weather API to connect the app to the
servers necessary to retrieve the correct weather data. No I do not know how this fully works I had a lot of help with this because I'm not good with coding at all sorry.
The png file and ico files are the images displayed in the window, the png is the background image and the ico is the icon displaying an appropriate weather cloud for the
correct weather that is happening in the selected location.
